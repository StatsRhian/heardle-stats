Personal Heardle stats comparison

## Ideas

- [ ] Grab heardle answers from [here](https://jessjoyce.com/historical-heardle/) Currently missing some...
- [ ] Could instead grab from this [spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX45XuBi1dgIM)?  Check the order against Jess's
- [ ] Parse and save as a `.csv` Store incase Jess's site goes down 
- [ ] Scrape guesses from Slack and Whatsapp
- [ ] Manually check any gaps
- [ ] Convert into win/loss
- [ ] Convert into how many guesses
- [ ] Colour analysis
- [ ] Genre / artist
